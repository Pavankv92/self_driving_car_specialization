    "* The shape of the variance profile of time is pretty much controlled by two parameters. It is controlled by the Q matrix and the R Matrix. So we've seen in the past from the prediction step, the Q matrix controls the rate of increase of uncertainty inside the system. It shows you how quickly the uncertainty is going to increase with time while the R Matrix is going to control how accurate the measurement is that we fuse into the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "* So the larger the Q matrix, the quicker the uncertainty grows between the updates, the smaller the R matrix is, the smaller is the updated covariance of the filter. So if we have a large Q metrics and a large R matrix or update, right, we might get a covariance profile that looks like Left graph. So you can see overall the uncertainty in the system is increasing, even though we're getting some updates to it. The update doesn't provide enough information to constrain the uncertainty inside the system. So this is a bad example of what we want to be. This filter isn't actually helping us all that much, because the longer we run the filter, the more uncertainty in the system we're going to get. So it's not going to be helping us to estimate anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Estimation problem_6](./images/estimation_problem_6.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "* The ideal case, what we want is when we have a small Q matrix and a small R matrix or a fast update. And we'll get the uncertainty inside the system looking like this (Right image) where even though we increase the uncertainty during the predictions, whenever we get an update, it brings the uncertainty down a greater amount than increased during the prediction step.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Over time, we can see that the uncertainty is going to be converging and it's going to converge down to a steady state value. And this steady state value is going to be based on the ratio of the Q and R Matrices, as well as the update rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "* An interesting thing to see from the equations here is that the final covariance P is a function of Kalman game matrix K, which is a function of our covariance innovation, is now you can see during these questions here, none of these actually has to do with the current state of the system, the current state of the system X does not appear in any of these equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Basically what that is saying is that our covariance with time is independent of the current state. The more updates we get, the smaller the P matrix is going to be in ideal conditions and since variance with time does not depend on the current state X, it is possible to predict how accurate filter estimates are going to be over the long term. So if we run the filter for long enough, our covariance is going to converge down to a constant non-zero value and that value is going to be based on our Q and our R matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If we know the amount of process noise in the filter and we know how good our measurements are, we can work out overall how good our state estimates are going to be. So we can use this information in the engineering design process and work out an area budget so we can work out how good our sensors have to be to make the level performance we want to.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Depending on our application, we might find out that we don't need a really high quality sensor. We might be able to get away with using a low quality sensor at lower cost."
